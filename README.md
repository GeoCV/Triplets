# Learning on Ordinal data

The purpose of this repository is to perform analysis of of various
algorithms that solve optimization routines in order to recover
a low dimensional embedding that preserves some ordinal constraints.

## Algorithm 1: Projected Gradient descent commonly known as
   stochastic triplet embeddign

## Algorithm 2: Non convex entropy minimization commonly known as Crowd kernel
