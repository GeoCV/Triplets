# Triplets

The purpose of this repository is to perform analysis of of various
algorithms that solve the triplets probelem. In general the triplets
problem involves recovering a low dimensional embedding, using a known
noise function and ordinal constraints of the form, object i is closer
to k than object j. For more details refer to
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07081) by Lalit Jain and Kevin
Jamieson.

This repository was created for a class project for a topics course in
Machine learning at University Of Wisconsin Madison. Our results is best summarised
in the [following paper]()

NOTE: Completely documenting the code has been put off due to other exisiting workload.
